# Story behind Brand Central âœ¨

Brand Central is the hub for SLOT token syndicates. 
It can have a token gated chat where validators will be able to create communities and discuss how they plan to utilize their StakeHouse assets and SLOT based revenue. 
Those who want to purchase a StakeHouse brand do so by creating a StakeHouse. 
This gives them an NFT that represents the wallet as the founder of the StakeHouse established.

<i>BlockSwap will be allowing SHB holders to reserve 50 StakeHouse names prior to mainnet through Brand Central Auction in October.</i>

StakeHouses may also be kept exclusive amongst a group of people such as a DAO, venture capital fund, or a group of friends. 
This gives the freedom for users to implement their own proprietary network layer and only allow the optimal amount of validators to participate.

There is also the option to add a KYC layer if a large institution is looking to start a StakeHouse.
